Contains Interesting libraries and functions ported from other languages
Starting with PHP & Coldfusion.

I have partially ported few interesting functions that I am going to add to this project. 
Some of the implementations are of questionable nature since these were coded while traveling inside a train. 


Notes:

1. These libraries are mostly pre JDK 1.5, needs to be cleaned up and ported to JDK 1.7
2. Documentation and jar comments are partally lacking.
3. JUnit testcases: some are to be imported/uploaded and rest to create.
4. Remove lot of test code & main methods to factories/testcases.
5. Add antfile & build targets for jar-ing & testing.
6. More to be added as needed.

How to use these:
This is built as a eclipse project and you can either use the jar inside the dist folder or you can build it yourself and generate the jar manually.
